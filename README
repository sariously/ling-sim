LingSim v1.0

LingSim was developed by Sara Kazemi for an M.A. thesis project in Computational Linguistics at San Diego State University (Forthcoming). It attempts to model the processes of linguistic diffusion, which contributes to language change and variation.

The simulation was created in NetLogo v5.0.4, developed by Uri Wilensky at The Center for Connected Learning at Northwestern University. You will need NetLogo (http://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/) to run the simulation. Feel free to utilize the simulation for educational demonstrations or to extend it for your own project! But please cite: Kazemi, S. (2014). LingSim (Version #) [Software] Available from https://github.com/sariously/ling-sim.

Once you download this code and open it in NetLogo, you will be able to see how it works by looking at the code under the Code tab and through a written description (following the ODD Protocol) under the Info tab.
